Note that app_execjs.so isn't a real world application, it's only for demonstration.

To test this one:

in extensions.conf:

exten => 555,1,Answer()
exten => 555,2,ExecJS(/tmp/test.js)
exten => 555,n,handup()

in /tmp/test.js :

testFunction()
{
    playback("pbx-invalid");
    dial("SIP/1001");
}
testFunction();


At this moment only 3 asterisk applications can be called from Javascript layer: Echo , PlayBack and Dial.

However you can add other functions that pointe to other asterisk applications'.
